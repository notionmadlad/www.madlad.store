                    I&apos;m High School student, currently sophmore, who found
                    a passion in programming and productivity. I had been a
                    programmer for over 4 years when I stumbled across Notion.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-[18px] text-foreground xl:text-[20px]">
                    The power of this tool surprised me. I always liked building
                    websites and application to simplify our user&apos;s life.
                    Though coding is still my go-to option to build complex
                    projects, Notion is still a really important and useful tool
                    for my daily life.

                    Many struggle to be organized and productive, and I
                    understand why. So, if I can help hundreds of people, why
                    shouldn&apos;t I? This is why Coding Madlad was created.

                    My goal is to help individuals get organized with Notion. In
                    the past year I have helped over 100 people get organized
                    with Notion. Notion is designed to simplify your life. And
                    I&apos;m here to assist you.

                    As I mentioned earlier, along with Notion, I also build
                    websites and help clients display their work like a pro.
